### Muffin

The Cinnamon Window Manager

Based on Mutter 3.2.1

The standalone `muffin` binary is not used by the Cinnamon desktop, and is mainly a code example, but may sometimes be used for troubleshooting.  Cinnamon is its own window manager, and uses the muffin libraries (compiled from this source tree, and whose binaries are also available in APT package `muffin-common`) to perform this task.  

Therefore, you canâ€™t just use a different window manager or compositor with Cinnamon (this is the same architecture as in gnome-shell, from which Cinnamon is derived).
